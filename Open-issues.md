# Open Issues & Improvements

This document tracks all open bugs and improvements. Bugs (BUG-XXX) are code that is broken or behaving incorrectly. Improvements (IMP-XXX) are enhancements to existing features or new additions that do not warrant a full phase in the roadmap.

For phases, planning, and roadmap work see `Plan-and-roadmap.md`.

## Open Bugs

### BUG-08 · Viewer discard tiles not visible in the center of the table — 3D UI

**Symptom:** The viewer's own discard tiles (pile in center-south zone) do not appear visible in the 3D scene.

**Status:** OPEN — deferred post-Phase-12B

**Suspected cause:** Depth-sorting issue. `MeshBasicMaterial` face stamps use `depthWrite: false` to prevent transparent SVG fragments from z-fighting. When tiles overlap at similar Y heights, Three.js may render some behind felt or other tiles.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/r3f/components/DiscardPool3D.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/r3f/components/MahjongTile3D.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/r3f/utils/table-layout.ts` — `discardPoses` offset

**Approach:** Try enabling `depthTest: false` on face stamps and/or adding small Y offset per discard row; or sort tiles back-to-front manually.

### BUG-09 · TileWall3D removed; needs redesign — 3D UI

**Symptom:** The tile wall (remaining draw tiles as rectangular frame) was removed because `Back.svg` has bright-red `fill:#ff3737` background.

**Status:** OPEN — deferred post-Phase-12B

**Fix needed:** Either replace `Back.svg` background with neutral colour (dark grey `#2a2a2a`) or render wall slots as plain `MeshBasicMaterial` boxes instead of textured.

**Current state:** `TileWall3D` component still exists and is fully functional — just not mounted in `GameCanvas.tsx`.

**Reinstate in:** `apps/web/src/r3f/GameCanvas.tsx` — re-add import and `<TileWall3D wallCount={snapshot.wallCount} ... />`.

### BUG-045 · Bot dice roll animation not visible

**Symptom:** When a bot takes a dice roll (deal_1, deal_2, or jing_reveal), the animation and result flash by in under a frame — effectively invisible. Human-triggered dice rolls display correctly (full 3s animation with 1.75s of readable result).

**Status:** OPEN — deferred post-PR #115

**Investigation so far:** The 3500ms bot server delay was expected to give a 500ms gap after the human animation clears (`onAnimationComplete` at t=3.0s), preventing a `setDiceAnimation(null)` race. The race appears to still occur or there is a separate render-cycle issue causing `diceAnimation` to be cleared immediately after being set for bot rolls.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-game.ts` — `handleGameEvent` dice_roll branch, `onDiceAnimationComplete` callback, `isDiceAnimatingRef` / `snapshotQueueRef` interaction
- `apps/web/src/components/2d/DiceRollOverlay.tsx` — `onAnimationComplete` on `motion.p`; whether the animation is actually mounting/running for bot rolls
- `apps/api/src/game/game.service.ts` — `doBotRollIfNeeded` timing (currently 3500ms)

**Suspected cause:** The `onDiceAnimationComplete` guard (`if (!isDiceAnimatingRef.current) return`) may not be sufficient. A bot roll that arrives while the previous `setDiceAnimation(null)` and snapshot-flush are mid-flight in the React render cycle may result in `diceAnimation` being cleared in the same render batch. Consider replacing the `onAnimationComplete`-driven approach with an explicit `setTimeout` in the `dice_roll` event handler keyed to the animation duration.
