## Open Bugs

### BUG-045 · Bot dice roll animation not visible

**Symptom:** When a bot takes a dice roll (deal_1, deal_2, or jing_reveal), the animation and result flash by in under a frame — effectively invisible. Human-triggered dice rolls display correctly (full 3s animation with 1.75s of readable result).

**Status:** OPEN — deferred post-PR #115

**Investigation so far:** The 3500ms bot server delay was expected to give a 500ms gap after the human animation clears (`onAnimationComplete` at t=3.0s), preventing a `setDiceAnimation(null)` race. The race appears to still occur or there is a separate render-cycle issue causing `diceAnimation` to be cleared immediately after being set for bot rolls.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-game.ts` — `handleGameEvent` dice_roll branch, `onDiceAnimationComplete` callback, `isDiceAnimatingRef` / `snapshotQueueRef` interaction
- `apps/web/src/components/2d/DiceRollOverlay.tsx` — `onAnimationComplete` on `motion.p`; whether the animation is actually mounting/running for bot rolls
- `apps/api/src/game/game.service.ts` — `doBotRollIfNeeded` timing (currently 3500ms)

**Suspected cause:** The `onDiceAnimationComplete` guard (`if (!isDiceAnimatingRef.current) return`) may not be sufficient. A bot roll that arrives while the previous `setDiceAnimation(null)` and snapshot-flush are mid-flight in the React render cycle may result in `diceAnimation` being cleared in the same render batch. Consider replacing the `onAnimationComplete`-driven approach with an explicit `setTimeout` in the `dice_roll` event handler keyed to the animation duration.

### BUG-049 · Player's own hand not visible during settlement phase — PC/desktop

**Symptom:** On PC (desktop browser), the player cannot see their own hand while the game is in the settlement phase. Reported during playtest.

**Status:** OPEN

**Suspected cause:** The settlement phase (`preGamePhase === 'settlement'`, the bonus-tile payout step shown only under `ruleTopBottomJing`) renders the `SettlementPreview` component as a **full-screen takeover** that occupies the whole viewport and never renders the viewer's concealed hand. This is fine on mobile (small screen, sequential flow) but on a wide PC screen there is ample room to show the hand alongside the settlement table, and players expect it to remain visible.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/game/game-page.tsx:261` — `if (phase === 'settlement')` branch returns `<SettlementPreview .../>` full-screen with no hand.
- `apps/web/src/components/game/SettlementPreview.tsx` — full-screen settlement layout; does not render the viewer hand.

**Approach:** Either render the viewer's hand within `SettlementPreview` (e.g. a bottom hand rail on wide viewports), or keep the game table mounted underneath and overlay the settlement summary rather than replacing the screen. Confirm whether the same is expected for the pre-game `bonus`/`jing` reveal steps.

### BUG-051 · Discard blocked after declining tsumo win

**Symptom:** During a playtest, a player drew a tile that completed a winning hand. The "Declare Win" prompt appeared. The player pressed "Keep Playing" to decline the win. After that, no tile could be discarded — the hand was stuck. The "Declare Win" button remained pressable, but the player could not continue by discarding.

**Status:** OPEN — critical gameplay bug, reported playtest 2026-06-14.

**Suspected cause:** When the client receives the self-draw win offer, it enters a state where the action buttons include "Declare Win" and "Keep Playing". After pressing "Keep Playing", the expected behaviour is to fall back to the normal discard phase (the player holds 14 tiles and must discard one). The likely failure modes are:

1. The server does not send a new `game:snapshot` after the decline, leaving the client in the `tsumo-win-pending` action phase with no discard buttons mounted.
2. The client-side action reducer does not transition back to the `discard` phase on a "keep playing" action, so `ActionBar` never renders the discard UI.
3. The server correctly transitions but the decline socket event is never acknowledged / the phase update is swallowed.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/api/src/game/game.service.ts` — handler for the "decline tsumo" / "keep playing" event; confirm it calls `toClientSnapshot` and emits `game:snapshot` back to the decliner.
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-game.ts` — `handleDeclineTsumo` (or equivalent) client event emitter; confirm the round-trip snapshot is processed.
- `apps/web/src/pages/game/game-page.tsx` — `ActionBar` / action-phase logic; confirm that phase `'discard'` renders discard buttons after the decline.
- `apps/web/src/stores/game.store.ts` — action phase derivation; confirm declining a tsumo win sets `actionPhase` back to `'discard'`.

### BUG-052 · Customize palette cards show tiles using the active palette instead of their own

**Symptom:** In the Customize page, the Tile Face section shows three preview cards (Classic, Sepia, Dark). Each card should display sample tiles rendered in _that card's own_ palette so the player can compare them. Instead, all three cards show tiles rendered in the currently-selected palette — e.g. if Dark is active, all three card previews show dark tiles.

**Status:** OPEN — visual bug, reported playtest 2026-06-14.

**Root cause:** `PaletteCard` renders `MahjongTile2D`, which builds its tile-face gradient from the global CSS custom properties `--tile-face-top` and `--tile-face-bottom`. These are written to `:root` by `applyTheme()` using the _current_ active palette only. All three cards inherit the same global values.

**Fix:** Pass the card's own `TilePalette` id into `PaletteCard` and scope the CSS vars to the preview strip by wrapping it in a `<div>` with inline `style={{ '--tile-face-top': cfg.faceTop, '--tile-face-bottom': cfg.faceBottom }}`. CSS custom properties cascade, so `MahjongTile2D`'s `var(--tile-face-top)` will pick up the scoped override rather than the global root value.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/customize/customize-page.tsx` — `PaletteCard` component (line ~107) and its call site (line ~279).
- `apps/web/src/lib/theme.utils.ts` — `TILE_CONFIGS` (already exported) provides `faceTop`/`faceBottom` per palette.

### BUG-054 · Learn page "Hands" tab shows incomplete example hands

**Symptom:** In the Learn page → Hands tab, three of the five hand examples are cut short and do not show a complete 14-tile winning hand:

- **Small Seven Pairs** — renders only 7 tiles (`slice(0, 7)`), showing half the pairs instead of all 7.
- **Thirteen Misfits** — renders only 9 tiles (`slice(0, 9)`), omitting the honor tiles entirely.
- **Seven Star Thirteen Misfits** — renders only 7 tiles (`[...WINDS, ...DRAGS]`), showing each honor once rather than a valid 14-tile hand with all 7 honors plus 7 numbered tiles.

**Status:** OPEN — reported 2026-06-14.

**Root cause:** All three hands use slice or partial arrays in `HandsSection`. `SEVEN_PAIRS_HAND` and `THIRTEEN_HAND` already contain the correct 14 tiles but are sliced at render time. Seven Star has no complete data array defined.

**Fix needed:**

- Remove `.slice(0, 7)` from the Seven Pairs `<TileRow>`.
- Remove `.slice(0, 9)` from the Thirteen Misfits `<TileRow>`.
- Add a `SEVEN_STAR_HAND: TileType[]` constant with all 7 unique honors (east, south, west, north, zhong, fa, bai) + 7 numbered tiles with inter-tile gaps > 2 (e.g. 1m, 4m, 7m, 1p, 4p, 7p, 1s) = 14 tiles total. Use that constant in the Seven Star `<TileRow>` instead of `[...WINDS, ...DRAGS]`.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/learn/learn-page.tsx` — `HandsSection` (~line 360), `SEVEN_PAIRS_HAND` (~line 53), `THIRTEEN_HAND` (~line 78).

### IMP-032 · Always-available global sound toggle next to the language toggle

**Request:** Add a sound on/off toggle next to the language (translations) toggle so sound can be turned on or off at all times, from anywhere in the app.

**Status:** OPEN

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/i18n/index.tsx:77` — `LangToggle` component (the translations toggle).
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/screen-shell.tsx:51` — `<LangToggle />` rendered in the shared header; also inline at `apps/web/src/pages/auth/auth-page.tsx:176` and `apps/web/src/pages/game/game-page.tsx:2700`.
- `apps/web/src/stores/theme.store.ts` — `soundEnabled` state (currently toggled on Home and Customize pages).
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-sound.ts` — sound playback gate.

**Notes:** Build a small `SoundToggle` that reads/writes `soundEnabled` from the theme store and place it adjacent to `LangToggle` wherever that renders (ideally the shared `ScreenShell` header, so it's available globally). Keep the existing Home/Customize toggles in sync via the same store. Add an `aria-label` mirroring `LangToggle`'s accessibility treatment.
