# Open Issues & Improvements

This document tracks all open bugs and improvements. Bugs (BUG-XXX) are code that is broken or behaving incorrectly. Improvements (IMP-XXX) are enhancements to existing features or new additions that do not warrant a full phase in the roadmap.

For phases, planning, and roadmap work see `Plan-and-roadmap.md`. For issues that are known but not actively planned, see `Deferred-issues.md`.

## Open Bugs

### BUG-045 · Bot dice roll animation not visible

**Symptom:** When a bot takes a dice roll (deal_1, deal_2, or jing_reveal), the animation and result flash by in under a frame — effectively invisible. Human-triggered dice rolls display correctly (full 3s animation with 1.75s of readable result).

**Status:** OPEN — deferred post-PR #115

**Investigation so far:** The 3500ms bot server delay was expected to give a 500ms gap after the human animation clears (`onAnimationComplete` at t=3.0s), preventing a `setDiceAnimation(null)` race. The race appears to still occur or there is a separate render-cycle issue causing `diceAnimation` to be cleared immediately after being set for bot rolls.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-game.ts` — `handleGameEvent` dice_roll branch, `onDiceAnimationComplete` callback, `isDiceAnimatingRef` / `snapshotQueueRef` interaction
- `apps/web/src/components/2d/DiceRollOverlay.tsx` — `onAnimationComplete` on `motion.p`; whether the animation is actually mounting/running for bot rolls
- `apps/api/src/game/game.service.ts` — `doBotRollIfNeeded` timing (currently 3500ms)

**Suspected cause:** The `onDiceAnimationComplete` guard (`if (!isDiceAnimatingRef.current) return`) may not be sufficient. A bot roll that arrives while the previous `setDiceAnimation(null)` and snapshot-flush are mid-flight in the React render cycle may result in `diceAnimation` being cleared in the same render batch. Consider replacing the `onAnimationComplete`-driven approach with an explicit `setTimeout` in the `dice_roll` event handler keyed to the animation duration.

### BUG-049 · Player's own hand not visible during settlement phase — PC/desktop

**Symptom:** On PC (desktop browser), the player cannot see their own hand while the game is in the settlement phase. Reported during playtest.

**Status:** OPEN

**Suspected cause:** The settlement phase (`preGamePhase === 'settlement'`, the bonus-tile payout step shown only under `ruleTopBottomJing`) renders the `SettlementPreview` component as a **full-screen takeover** that occupies the whole viewport and never renders the viewer's concealed hand. This is fine on mobile (small screen, sequential flow) but on a wide PC screen there is ample room to show the hand alongside the settlement table, and players expect it to remain visible.

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/game/game-page.tsx:261` — `if (phase === 'settlement')` branch returns `<SettlementPreview .../>` full-screen with no hand.
- `apps/web/src/components/game/SettlementPreview.tsx` — full-screen settlement layout; does not render the viewer hand.

**Approach:** Either render the viewer's hand within `SettlementPreview` (e.g. a bottom hand rail on wide viewports), or keep the game table mounted underneath and overlay the settlement summary rather than replacing the screen. Confirm whether the same is expected for the pre-game `bonus`/`jing` reveal steps.

## Open Improvements

**Request:** Add a sound on/off toggle next to the language (translations) toggle so sound can be turned on or off at all times, from anywhere in the app.

**Status:** OPEN

**Where to look:**

- `apps/web/src/i18n/index.tsx:77` — `LangToggle` component (the translations toggle).
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/screen-shell.tsx:51` — `<LangToggle />` rendered in the shared header; also inline at `apps/web/src/pages/auth/auth-page.tsx:176` and `apps/web/src/pages/game/game-page.tsx:2700`.
- `apps/web/src/stores/theme.store.ts` — `soundEnabled` state (currently toggled on Home and Customize pages).
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-sound.ts` — sound playback gate.

**Notes:** Build a small `SoundToggle` that reads/writes `soundEnabled` from the theme store and place it adjacent to `LangToggle` wherever that renders (ideally the shared `ScreenShell` header, so it's available globally). Keep the existing Home/Customize toggles in sync via the same store. Add an `aria-label` mirroring `LangToggle`'s accessibility treatment.
